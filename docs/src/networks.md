# Networks

LazyLora supports multiple Algorand networks:

## MainNet

The production Algorand network. This is the default network when you start LazyLora.

## TestNet

The Algorand test network for development and testing. Useful for exploring test transactions without real ALGO.

## LocalNet

Connect to a local Algorand node running on your machine. This is useful for developers running [AlgoKit LocalNet](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli) or a custom local node.

## Switching Networks

Press `n` while in the main view to cycle through available networks. The current network is displayed in the status bar.
